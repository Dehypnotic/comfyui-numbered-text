# Numbered Text (ComfyUI custom node)
Node for handling text with automatic numbering of divisions and extraction of selected division(s).

A new text division is created for every Return/Enter.

Pick a text divison via the index and output only that text’s content (without the optional “n. ” prefix). Alternatively select several text divisions and an optional separator string. Empty lines are ignored.

Lightweight, no additional dependencies.

1-based indexing.

## Usage ideas
I find it useful for prompts. You get a new idea, hit enter and start anew without discarding the old; select, go back, combine; or you can load/paste a list of frequently used prompts and save/copy them for later. May also be useful in combination with a save node for several disk locations, etc.
