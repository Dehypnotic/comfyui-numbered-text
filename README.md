# Numbered Text (ComfyUI custom node)
Simple node for handling multi-line text with automatic line numbering and extracting a selected line.

Always auto-numbers lines (1., 2., 3., …)

Pick a line via 1-based index and output only that line’s content (without the “n. ” prefix)

Read-only “gutter”-style preview with line numbers on the left, intended for display nodes
